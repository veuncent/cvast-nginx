# Local and Remote proxies
By default, all traffic on the root path (/) is forwarded using the HTTP protocol to the location specified in the LOCAL_PROXY_HOST environment variable.  
In addition, you can (optionally) route traffic for a specific subpath (REMOTE_PROXY_SUBPATH env variable) to another destination (REMOTE_PROXY_HOST env variable). For this, the original protocol (http/https) of the request is used.
